- Install RtMidi library for MIDI I/O


- Phase modulation only works for Sine Oscillators (so that it behaves like FM), not for any other
- Do something about the horrible use of pointers during algorithm generation
- Some features are missing from the Patch class. Namely waveform, vpk (WIP) and name data

--------- VERY IMPORTANT ----------
THERE IS CURRENTLY A MEMORY LEAK IN THE ALGORITHM PART OF THE PROGRAM
WHILE THE BLOCK AND OPERATORS CAN BE DELETED THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTS THEY
ARE MADE OF CANNOT!!!!!!! 
POSSIBLE SOLUTION: ADD A VECTOR THAT HOLDS THE CONSTRUCTS SO THAT THEY TOO
CAN BE DELETED!!!!! (maybe)

1st test : ~122.5 sec


Temporary:
- SoundEngine Constructor: only patch at the index of 0 is passed to the renderer
- SoundEngine: temporary able to call process command. Will have in and out interfaces in the future
