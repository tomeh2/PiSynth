- Install RtMidi library for MIDI I/O


- Phase modulation only works for Sine Oscillators (so that it behaves like FM), not for any other

- Do something about the horrible use of pointers in algorithm generation


--------- VERY IMPORTANT ----------
THERE IS CURRENTLY A MEMORY LEAK IN THE ALGORITHM PART OF THE PROGRAM
WHILE THE BLOCK AND OPERATORS CAN BE DELETED THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTS THEY
ARE MADE OF CANNOT!!!!!!! 
POSSIBLE SOLUTION: ADD A VECTOR THAT HOLDS THE CONSTRUCTS SO THAT THEY TOO
CAN BE DELETED!!!!!
